# ðŸ•¸ Web Scraping The Office

## About this Project

In this project, I scrape all lines from Seasons 1 through 9 of [The Office](https://www.officequotes.net/).

For a Step-by-Step tutorial, read this [Medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/step-by-step-web-scraping-every-line-from-the-office-in-python-3b28768c56f4).

## Inspiration

I love The Office and have been a fan since it aired on NBC every Thursday night way back when. It only made sense that I eventually got around to pulling in every line ever said in my favorite TV show.

    `$ python3 --version`
